# SIR
Methods to analyze the dynamic spread model of infectious diseases and its influencing factors
1. Computes the basic reproduction number (R0) by optimizing infection and recovery rates for different groups
2. Simulates SIR dynamics for each group and visualizes the results as a time-series grid and infection ratio plot
3. Identifies key features influencing R0 using a random forest regressor and visualizes their importance
# Quick Start (With examples)
